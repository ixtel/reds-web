#REDS.web

REDS.web is an open-source web application framework based on the REDS data storage concept. The framework is mainly written in JavaScript and contains the code for all client- and server-side components required to run a webapp with REDS. It is still under development and considered unstable, therefore we cannot recommended to use REDS.web on production systems right now.

The REDS concept allows users to decide freely where they want to store their data. All data transfers and account information are encrypted, so the webapp can be used privately and anonymously. However, the provider can still control the access to the webapp and its data, so it is still possible to run a service based on subscriptions or a freemium model. All details about how REDS works can be found in the [REDS.concept repository](https://github.com/flowyapps/reds-concept) here on GitHub.

## Example

The [REDS.web example repository](https://github.com/flowyapps/reds-web-example) contains a simple webapp that uses the REDS.web framework to store all user generated data. You can use the example to get a first impression of REDS and as a boilerplate for your own webapp based on REDS. If you don't want to bother with the installion you can also download ready-to-use virtual machines from the [download section on reds.io](http://reds.io/download#vms).

## Documentation

The [REDS.web API Documentation](https://github.com/flowyapps/reds-web/wiki/REDS.web-API-Documentation) can be found in Wiki. Like REDS itself is is still under development and may change along with the code.

All documents describing the REDS standard itself, are located in the [REDS.concept repository here on GitHub](https://github.com/flowyapps/reds-concept).
