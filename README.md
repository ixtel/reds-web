#REDS.web

REDS.web is an open-source web application framework based on the [REDS concept](https://github.com/flowyapps/reds-concept). REDS is a distributed data storage concept for cloud services, whichs allows the anonymous and encrypted usage of a service, but preserves the ability of the service owner control access to the service.

The framework is mainly written in JavaScript and contains the code for all client- and server-side components required to run a webapp with REDS. It is still under development and considered unstable, therefore we cannot recommended to use REDS.web on production systems right now.

The REDS.web is maintained by Flowy Apps. More information about REDS and Flowy Apps be found on the following websites:
